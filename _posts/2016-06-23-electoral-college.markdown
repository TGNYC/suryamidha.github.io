## Introduction
So, there's been one man in the news lately, and that's been Donald Trump. He seems to have swept the polls in states that have already voted. And in China, their state owned newspaper used Donald Trump as a example that democracy doesn't work. Regardless of what you think of the man, from the polls we've seen, the majority of republicans don't like Donald Trump. He's wining states with 30, maybe 40 percent of the vote. Which begs the questions, **is our system of democracy broken?**

## The Answer
To answer that question we have to open up the history textbook. Back to when our founding fathers really "founded" our country. So, at the time, the founding fathers had this problem with letting everyone vote, and whoever got the most votes became president. The problem was that they feared **an oppressive ruler would twist public opinion and take power**. Here's what Alexander Hamilton wrote in the federalist papers:

> It was equally desirable, that **the immediate election should be made by men most capable** of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station, and acting under circumstances favorable to deliberation, and to a judicious combination of all the reasons and inducements which were proper to govern their choice. **A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated investigations.** It was also peculiarly desirable to afford as little opportunity as possible to tumult and disorder. **This evil was not least to be dreaded in the election of a magistrate (a civil officer or lay judge who administers the law)**, who was to have so important an agency in the administration of the government as the President of the United States. **But the precautions which have been so happily concerted in the system under consideration, promise an effectual security against this mischief.**

Let's back it up a little bit. Basically, Hamilton is saying that the most educated people are those in congress, and the general public is not always adept enough to elect a president all by themselves. So, what's the solution?

### The Solution
**Electoral College.** Here's how it works. People from each state have a certain number of delegates. The number of delegates they have depends on the number of people they have in congress, which is at least 3, and at most 55. So, as an example, let's say that I have 100 people in my state. Because of the population, my state has 4 people in Congress. So, each delegate represents 25 people. Meaning, if I get 25 people to vote for me, I now have one delegate. Now I go next door the neighboring state. Over there, the population is 30 people, but they have 3 delegates. Now, each delegate is worth 10 votes. Do you see the debate here? Why is a delegate worth 25 votes in one place, but 10 votes in another? And the election is decided by whoever wins the most delegates. That means, even if one person gets more votes than their opponent, they can still loose the election because the other could have gotten their support more spread out. This has happened four times in general elections, in 1824, 1876, 1888, and most recently in 2000. Gore got nearly half a million more votes than Bush, but Gore had 266 delegates to Bush's 271. Meaning, states with delegates that had less voters behind them, or small populations were the ones that Bush won. And so the question is, is this all democratic?

## Conversation
There are some obvious positives. **Minorities are protected** who reside in states with lower populations and states have more power, which upholds a **representative form of government**. On the other hand, an electoral college doesn't always give win to the majority as we saw wish the Bush Gore example. Also **people feel like their vote doesn't count**. For one delegate, one needs 705,454 votes in California, but only 194,717 in Wyoming. 

## Conclusion
So what do you think? Are you part of the **60%** of americans who don't stand behind the electoral college system, or the **40%** who think that states should decide. Oh Democracy, Democracy, Democracy.
