## Introduction

This podcast is trying out a new segment: Politics of Today. Here we ask the kids of today about the politics of tomorrow. Even though they can't vote, they bring convincing arguments to the table that put a spotlight on how our youth think about the adult world.

## Issues

Talked about points included:
* Presidential Age
* Bernie's appeal to youth
* Hillary's and Trump's untrustworthy characteristics
* Gary Johnson and the Libretarian Party

## Conclusion
